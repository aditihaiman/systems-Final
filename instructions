Welcome!

When you first begin your game, you will be prompted for a name for your player.
Once you've chosen a name for your player, you will be given the choice of either going through the forest or the desert. The two settings yield different storylines so choose wisely.
Throughout this game, you will be prompted to make decisions for your player until you reach the end of the game. You will encounter many monsters along your journey. The more monsters you defeat, the more experienced you become, and therefore the more
you are able to move forward in the story. Remember, if you encounter more and more monsters, it means you're heading in the right direction. There are four levels to this game, and in each level, you will encounter four random monsters. If you can defeat all
the monsters in that level, you will automatically move forward in the plot and go into the next level.

The player gets to choose a character. Each character has a different storyline.
- In order to move the story forward, the user will have to make decisions for the character regarding where to go, how to confront other characters, etc. The user will get prompts such as “There is a door to your left and an open hallway to your right. Where would you like to go? [left /right]” The user will input their desired command, and the character will act accordingly.
- When fighting a monster, a new window/terminal process will open temporarily.
- The stories will sometimes have riddles that the user must answer in order to move forward. Here’s an example:
-    You meet a forest troll who refuses your passage unless you can answer his three riddles. If you pass, the troll will let you through. If you fail, the troll will eat you.
-    Riddle #1: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
  -    Answer: every year

- Some monsters can only be defeated by rolling a twenty-sided dice that will determine how much damage you will do to the monster’s health. You and the monster will deal the dice until one of you dies. If you succeed, you will regain your health and immediately advance forward in the storyline.
- Whenever the user interacts with a monster, if they defeat it, they will automatically move forward in the story. The user will face a monster randomly in the game. The user will also find certain objects such as a sword or a bag of coins, which can be used as powerups when they are facing monsters.
