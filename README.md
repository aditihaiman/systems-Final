Project Name: Cellars and Serpents
Project Members: Sowjan Sritharasarma and Aditi Haiman (both pd 10)

Project Description:


Instructions:


Known Bugs:
  - When asking for an input, sometimes the fgets() function fails to work and entirely skips over waiting for the user to enter an input. Instead it goes directly to the next part of the program.
  - Sometimes, the input provided by the user is changed by replacing the first character with a space (we think this is somehow an issue with fgets() as well). This impacts the ability of the program to continue because the input doesn't match what would advance the game.
